Description:
This project is a rougelike autobattler. The idea is that there will be a charecter representing the player that fights waves of enemies automatically. Periodically the player will have a choice of a few power-ups to improve their charecters/stats or abilites. As the game progresses the enemies will also get more difficult. I plan on starting with 3 levels.

Instructions:
Your character (the knight) will automatically fight the enemies coming from the right. Upon defeating enough enemies they will level up, allowing you to choose an upgrade. 
Upon reaching level 10 you will fight the final boss. You may control the game speed using the slider under the game window. Your current stats are shown below the game.

In autobattler(official name tbd), users will be able to:
choose between items/upgrades
speed up time
examine the current stats/items of your charecter
Final boss after a certain amount of waves

In addition, this project will include:
enemies come from the right side of the screen and attack the player, doing damage in a range. The player will automatically fight back. You will be able to give your charecter items periodically, some of which may be able to be combined into stronger items.

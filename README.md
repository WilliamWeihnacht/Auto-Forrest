Description:

This project is a rougelike autobattler. The idea is that there will be a charecter representing the player that fights waves of enemies automatically. Periodically the player will have a choice of a few power-ups to improve their charecters/stats or abilites. As the game progresses the enemies will also get more difficult. I plan on starting with 3 levels.

In autobattler(official name tbd), users will be able to:

{ 4-6 core features or functionalities of your project }
choose between items/upgrades
speed up time
examine the current stats/items of your charecter
Final boss after a certain amount of waves
In addition, this project will include:

{ 2-4 other aspects of your project, including instructions & README }
enemies come from the right side of the screen and attack the player, doing damage in a range. The player will automatically fight back. You will be able to give your charecter items periodically, some of which may be able to be combined into stronger items.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs:
I'm planning on using a library to help with sprites such as Pixi.js
Otherwise just canvas I think
